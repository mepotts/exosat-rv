"""M32: regenerate every number in the eta Tel B research note from the stored JSONs.

The project's own audit (docs/PROPERTY-AUDIT.md) found 34 conflicting and 63 unsourced
values, almost all of them introduced by hand-transcription between a result and a
document. A note that goes outside the repo cannot carry that risk, so nothing in the
draft is typed: every figure is printed here from data/m15-limit.json and recomputed
from first principles, and the draft quotes this script's output.

Two things this makes explicit that prose would hide:

1. K90 is READ OFF THE MEASURED DETECTION GRID -- the smallest injected amplitude whose
   detected fraction reaches 0.90 -- not interpolated and not fitted. Where the grid does
   not reach 0.90 the entry is reported as a lower bound, not silently rounded down.

2. The msini sensitivity threshold scales as (host mass)^(2/3), and the adopted 47 M_Jup is
   single-source
   (Lazzoni+2022 Table 1, itself citing Langlois et al. 2021b, which this repo does not
   hold). So the headline number inherits an unverified input. The sensitivity table below
   states exactly how much the limit moves if that mass is wrong, so a reader with a better
   mass can rescale without re-running anything.
