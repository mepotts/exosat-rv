"""M34: historical configuration-sensitivity check, interpreted under M37's audit.

Extraction choices -- order set, template iteration, clipping, oversampling -- were scored
against Hoy et al.'s published RV values. Those values do not enter the period regression,
but its input series was selected using them. This script also matches published epochs
for rms scoring and reads a hard-coded window around the published period. It is not an
independent or paper-blind validation.

THE TEST. An existing sweep -- M13_A..M13_J and the M14 variants -- contains RV series
from the same spectra under different configurations. After the internal spread screen,
this script compares:

    rms against the published series   -- the metric that SELECTED the adopted configuration
    period-search dBIC near 171 d      -- support near the published period

The configurations share a family explored using the published RVs. Persistence of a peak
in poorer-matching configurations cannot rule out tuning artifacts or prove an astrophysical
origin. The correlation and counts are descriptive, not a calibrated test of overfitting.
The retained counts vary across configurations; dBIC > 10 here is not a detection probability.

M37 controls the adopted-series interpretation: near-171-day support is conditional on the
17-of-18-night internal screen. All 18 nights are compatible with noise in the BERV-adjusted
global searches. Those permutations assume exchangeable residuals and do not account for
choosing the screen. This script does not redo that complete-versus-screened audit.

Nothing here re-reduces spectra. It re-scores existing external runs.

⚠ ROUND 1 OF THIS SCRIPT WAS WRONG, and the way it was wrong is worth keeping. The period
search was reimplemented here "to avoid a dependency" -- a bad reason, since `blind_search.py`
takes a filename and there was no dependency to avoid -- and the reimplementation differed
from the project's combination and scoring conventions. It combined orders by
taking viper's own `RV` column instead of the MEDIAN ACROSS PER-ORDER RVs, and it fitted with
inverse-variance weights from the `e_RV` column, historically reported as 400-1000 m/s against
an estimated epoch precision of 70-90 m/s, where the project fits UNWEIGHTED and scores
BIC = n log(RSS/n) + k log(n) rather than chi-squared. The adopted configuration came out at
dBIC ~ 0 where M14 measured +24.8, and the script duly announced that the detection tracks the
tuning metric. That diagnosis rested on an inconsistent comparison. This version imports
the project's machinery for comparability with M14; agreement does not validate the error
model, establish independence, or rule out tuning effects.
