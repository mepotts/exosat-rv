"""M33: resolve every cited reference's bibliographic details from CrossRef.

The contrast-wall note's pre-submission item 6 asks for journal, volume and bibcode on four
references that are currently cited from archived full texts. The obvious tool is ADS, and ADS
needs an API token this machine does not have -- its API returns "Missing Authorization" and
its web interface is a JavaScript application that a fetch cannot read.

CrossRef needs no token and holds the same fields for anything with a DOI: journal, volume,
page, year, and the DOI itself. That covers item 6 completely. What it does NOT hold is the ADS
bibcode, which is an ADS-specific identifier; where a bibcode is genuinely wanted it still needs
a human with an ADS session, and that is stated rather than papered over.

Every match is printed with its CrossRef relevance score AND the queried title, so a wrong
match is visible rather than silently adopted. Nothing here rewrites a reference automatically:
this project has already shipped fifteen wrong citations, and an automatic rewriter would be a
sixteenth waiting to happen.

# DOI-first. CrossRef's bibliographic search is unreliable for A&A -- it returned an
# encyclopedia entry for one query and a 1988 symbiotic-star paper for another -- so any
# reference whose DOI is already verified is looked up by DOI, which is exact. Title search
# is the fallback and its result is always printed for eyeballing.
#
# ⚠ A DOI lookup is exact only if the DOI is VERIFIED. Two entries here were first filled
# from memory: one happened to be right and the other silently resolved to a different 2014
# A&A paper by another author, reported as "[by DOI - exact]" because the lookup succeeded.
# It is the printed TITLE that catches that, not the DOI mechanism. Every DOI below now
# traces to an archived copy, a verified reference list, or a match whose title was read.
