"""M29: test S = contrast / theta^2 against the systems held out of its construction.

M29 sec 7 found that neither contrast nor separation orders this project's extraction
outcomes, but their combination does: S = contrast / theta^2, the ratio of scattered host
flux to companion flux at the slit. It was built on six systems. Six points and two
classes separate under many statistics by chance, so the claim is worth nothing until it
predicts systems it was not built on.

This does that. It parses Lazzoni et al. 2022 Table 1 -- which carries Sep in mas, host
magnitude and companion magnitude for 37 companions, and which this project transcribed
only three columns of -- computes S for every system, and compares the prediction against
the extraction verdict this project reached independently.

The threshold is fixed in advance from the construction set: CLEAN below 4327, FAILS above
15202. Anything landing in between is recorded as INDETERMINATE rather than assigned to
whichever side would look better.

Known caveat carried through: Lazzoni's companion-magnitude column is apparent magnitude
(validated on YSES 1 b against Bohn+2020 to 0.14 mag) but is not uniformly reliable -- it
is wrong by 2.4 mag for beta Pic b against Currie+2013. Rows resting on it alone are
marked.
