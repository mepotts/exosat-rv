"""M29: which axis actually orders the extraction outcomes?

The project has stated its feasibility limit as a "contrast wall" since M20. With every
point now traced to a primary source, contrast alone does not order the outcomes, and
neither does separation alone:

  by contrast:    clean, fails, clean, clean, fails, clean   (no ordering)
  by separation:  fails, clean, fails, clean, clean, clean   (no ordering)

There is a physical reason to expect neither. What floods the slit is not the magnitude
ratio between host and companion; it is the host's light *scattered to the companion's
position*. That scales as the contrast times the PSF halo evaluated at the separation.
For a seeing- or AO-limited halo the wing falls roughly as theta^-2 to theta^-3, so the
natural quantity is

    S = contrast / theta^n

which is, to a constant, the ratio of scattered host flux to companion flux at the slit.

This tests whether S separates the outcomes, and over what range of n. With six points and
two classes many statistics will separate them by chance, so the exponent is NOT fitted:
n is scanned over the physically plausible range and the result reported for all of it.

Sources for every number are in the table below; nothing here is recalled.
