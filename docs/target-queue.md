# Target interrogation queue — audited status through M37 (2026-08-31)

> **M37 correction:** the first adjudicated roster below is current; later tier-planning
> sections are preserved as pre-audit history, not current claims. CD-35 2722 B is a
> conditional screened-series recovery, not an independent
> confirmation; the all-18-night BERV-adjusted searches are compatible with noise. The
> eta Tel result is grid-pointwise circular-orbit sensitivity conditional on the adopted
> extraction and fitter-stage transmission, not an unconditional upper limit or priority
> claim. All supposed staring-mode companion results were HiRISE fibre data reduced with
> an invalid slit recipe and are withdrawn.

> ## ⚠ THE HiRISE REVELATION (2026-08-13) — reopens the "staring" tier as M27
>
> Every dataset this project classified as "staring-mode" is actually **HiRISE**:
> fiber-fed SPHERE→CRIRES+ observations (`ESO INS MODE=HIRISE`, original files
> `HIRISE_SPEC_OBS*`) — the starlight-suppression hardware we said required new
> proposals. Verified on HD 1160 B, AF Lep b, 51 Eri b, HIP 81208 B (H series),
> PDS 70 (H nights), and the "BET PIC" H series — which is therefore **six public
> fiber nights of beta Pic b (Oct–Dec 2024), wall-free**. HD 26820's 11 nights and
> HD 19467/HD 206893's H pairs are the same programme family.
>
> **Corrections to ledgered conclusions:**
> - The M26 "nodding survives where staring drowns" methods finding is WRONG as
>   stated: HIP 81208's H series was fiber data mis-reduced through the slit
>   recipe; the km/s scatter is OUR processing, not the sky.
> - AF Lep b's "68% dilution" and 51 Eri b's "beyond slit reach": same error class.
> - HD 1160 B's "quality-limited" verdict: to be re-derived with fiber-appropriate
>   handling before it stands.
> - Conclusions that SURVIVE: everything on nodding data (CD-35, eta Tel,
>   HIP 65426 b, PDS 70-K, beta Pic b K-contamination, YSES 1, CT Cha, AB Pic),
>   and HD 19467/HD 206893's clean epochs (fiber data that happened to reduce well).

> **✅ M27 OPEN (M29 §19): the first correctly-reduced HiRISE data.** `reduce_hirise.sh` extracted **39/39 frames** of the 2025-02-02 β Pic b night, 21 orders each, wavelength-solved over 1499–1744 nm. Host S/N 62/pixel; planet **0.7/pixel** — real, calibrated, traced data but *not yet a measurement*. Validates against photometry: host/planet flux ratio 6027 vs an independently derived K-band contrast of 3954, agreeing to 1.5× in the direction a red companion requires. Seven more public β Pic nights and 1739 HiRISE frames across ~45 targets are now reachable. Original scoping: > **M27 (scoped M29 §13):** **EIGHT** public beta Pic HiRISE nights, not six — 294 frames over ~440 d, all **H1567**, so the project's eleven-order map and viper config apply unchanged. The 2025-02-02 night has `OBJECT = bet Pic b`. Confirmed why the slit recipe mangled them: `DPR TECH = SPECTRUM`, `SEQ NODPOS = None`, `TPL ID = HIRISE_spec_obs` — no nodding at all, and `classify.py` routes them to the *slit* staring recipe. Fibre traces are 2–9 px wide against ~180 px for a slit order. Open question is the extraction only; calibration cascade and the H1567 chain should work unchanged. The archive holds **1739 HiRISE science frames** across ~45 targets — the starlight-suppressed flagship
> series this project thought it couldn't have.

> **KOA/KPIC census (idea #2, probed):** HR 8799 holds ~25 NIRSPEC nights
> (2012–2024) and DH Tau ~27 (2000–2025) in the Keck archive; beta Pic b one.
> A NIRSPEC/KPIC pipeline is a real project with a real ceiling — parked as the
> post-M27 frontier. Ideas #3/#4 (full reverse census, isolated objects): closed,
> negative — the ESO sweep is exhaustive. Idea #5: no new claims to reproduce;
> Hoy et al. remains alone in the genre.

> across 3 nights (2022-11-07, 2022-12-23, 2023-11-20)** — the same configuration as CD-35
> and η Tel B, so the existing chain applies unchanged. Companion at 0.59″ against
> 0.86–1.31″ seeing. Clean, flooded or marginal, it is the first observation inside the
> **Reduced 2026-08-13 and the answer is no.** The night reduces cleanly (24/24 columns)

It reduces correctly once even, but fails the pre-committed M13 order screen (56% of orders kept, below the 2/3 bar), and even screened sits at 157–270 m/s. **YSES 1 b is a two-night series; the 290-d baseline does not exist in usable form.** |

> | **HD 19467 B** (benchmark T dwarf, wide) | 2 H staring nights | clean 45 m/s pair, gates 101±5% — excellent future target, archive thin |
> | **HD 206893** | 1 K night + 2 H staring | ⚠ **WITHDRAWN (M29 blending sweep):** the companion sits at **0.205″** (Kral+2026 GRAVITY astrometry at the CRIRES epoch) against a **0.393″** delivered PSF, so **R = 0.52** — the pair is inside one resolution element and the extraction is of the **host**. Profile height at the companion offset is 0.63 of the peak. The gates passing at 100–102% do not contradict this: the gate tests whether the *fitter* transmits velocity, which it does equally well on a bright star. **Not a companion measurement.** |

## Historical pre-audit planning tiers

The sections below preserve the queue as it was originally planned. They are not current
performance or priority claims. M37 found that the slit/nodding extraction was calibrated
with the published CD-35 series visible, that its internally screened result fails on all
18 nights, and that fitter-stage injections do not test signal survival through template
construction. The recipe therefore has not established general transferability. Any reuse
needs a target-appropriate, prospectively frozen protocol and full-pipeline controls.

Class note: every target below the brown-dwarf boundary here is a *young, self-luminous
giant* — 10⁴–10⁵× brighter than a field-age Jupiter, which is the only reason
companion-side spectroscopy works at all. The M7 screen says which of them offer
genuinely satellite-mass (sub-Jovian) science vs binary-mass limits.

## Tier 1 — analyzable today (archive orbit-capable)

| target | class | K | nights (public) | baseline | reachable |
|---|---|---:|---:|---:|---|
| **eta Tel B** | ~47 M_Jup BD, β Pic group, 24 Myr | 11.6 | 26 (22) | 815 d | M15 completed: no detection; conditional grid-pointwise circular-orbit sensitivity only (see M37) |

**This is M15.** Check the epoch sampling's phase–BERV geometry before anything else
(M13 §4b design rule).

## Tier 2 — partial archive: spot-checks now, not orbits

Young planetary-mass / borderline objects with CRIRES+ frames under their own OBJECT
name, but night structures that cannot constrain an orbit (M5 §3):

| target | mass | K | archive reality | what a spot-check yields |
|---|---:|---:|---|---|
| **beta Pic b** | 12.8 M_Jup | 14.9 | 753 frames = **6 nights** / 1034 d | HiRISE fibre holdings require a fibre-appropriate reduction; no companion-RV claim from the slit pipeline |
| AB Pic b | ~14 M_Jup | 15.1 | 64 frames = 4 consecutive nights (3 d) | single-epoch RV + short-term stability; no orbit |
| CT Cha B | M8 companion, accreting | — | 3 nights / 70 d | RV spot-check only |
| GSC 08047-00232 B | M9.5 | 16.4 | 3 nights (2 public) / 4 d | thin; skip unless free |

Note: programme **110.23RW** (the Hoy team's pilot survey) is the origin of the
AB Pic b / beta Pic b / CD-35 frames — assume the discovering team is actively
extending this sample.

## Tier 3 — physics-reachable, no archive: proposal targets

Where the method could reach **genuinely satellite-mass moons** (the exomoon regime),
but no orbit-capable CRIRES+ data exists yet:

| target | mass | age | K | expected per-epoch σ | min. detectable satellite |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| **beta Pic b** | 12.8 M_Jup | 16 Myr | 14.9 | ~357 m/s | **~214 M_Earth** |
| **PDS 70 b** | 7.9 M_Jup | 5 Myr | 15.2 | ~410 m/s | **~292 M_Earth** (has a known circumplanetary disk) |
| PDS 70 c | 7.8 M_Jup | 5 Myr | 15.2 | ~410 m/s | ~372 M_Earth (verdict: marginal) |

And the limits class — young planetary-mass objects where only 1–10 M_Jup companions
are reachable (still first-ever RV constraints on each): DH Tau B (10.6 M_Jup, ~326
m/s), GSC 6214-210 B (14, ~341), 2M1207 b (5, ~493), 1RXS J1609 b (8, ~897),
HR 8799 d (9.2, ~897), TYC 8047-232-1 B (13.8, ~712), TYC 8998-760-1 b (14, ~1632).

Out of reach at any plausible exposure: HR 8799 b/c/e, 51 Eri b, HD 95086 b,
HIP 65426 b, TYC 8998 c (K ≥ 18 or no measured K-band flux).

## Standing rules for any new target

1. No published-RV truth exists off CD-35 — the injection harness (full-amplitude +
   amplitude-matched, per-frame) carries the entire validation burden. Every internal
   metric in this project's history has lied at least once; do not substitute one for
   the harness.
2. Re-derive the order set from the telluric-density criterion for the target's
   setting; never copy `H_C`.
3. Re-run the template-iteration injection guard per target (M11 proved iteration can
   absorb signal; M14 proved it doesn't always — the guard decides which case you're in).
4. Phase–BERV geometry check before spending compute; a −0.7 entanglement bakes the
   M13 §4b ambiguity in from the start.
